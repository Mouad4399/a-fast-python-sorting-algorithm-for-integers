# a-fast-python-sorting-algorithm-for-integers

I have just begun learning Python and Algorithm structure. While learning, I am trying to implement my weird ideas, hoping to see them work as intended. Recently, I tried to compare the speed of Timsort (Sorting arrays) to common algorithms like binary insertion and bucket sorting and with functions that I made . And Step by step, I am getting closer to the speed of Timsort, and finally, after implementing one of my ideas, it was slower than Timsort for small sizes of arrays. However, for huge sizes, my custom algorithm is so fast!
