# a-fast-python-sorting-algorithm-for-integers

I have just begun learning Python and Algorithm structure. While learning, I am trying to implement my weird ideas, hoping to see them work as intended. Recently, I tried to make my own sorting algorithm , it is faster than regular popular algorithm like quicksort and mergesort .
This algorithm Belongs to bucket sorting and radix sorting algorithms
