# a-fast-python-sorting-algorithm-for-integers

I have just begun learning Python and Algorithm structure. While learning, I am trying to implement my weird ideas, hoping to see them work as intended. Recently, I tried to make my own sorting algorithm , it is faster than regular popular algorithm like quicksort and mergesort .
This algorithm Belongs to bucket sorting and radix sorting algorithms
# I tried to compare the speed of Timsort (Sorting arrays) to common algorithms like binary insertion and bucket sorting and with functions # that I made . And Step by step, I am getting closer to the speed of Timsort, and finally, after implementing one of my ideas, it was 
# slower than Timsort for small sizes of arrays. However, for huge sizes, my custom algorithm is so fast!
