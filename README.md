# a-fast-python-sorting-algorithm-for-integers

I have just begun learning Python and Algorithm structure. While learning, I am trying to implement my weird ideas, hoping to see them work as intended. Recently, I tried to make my own sorting algorithm , it is faster than regular popular algorithm like quicksort and mergesort .
This algorithm Belongs to bucket sorting and radix sorting algorithms

## implementation on Leetcode challenge : 912. Sort an Array
After submitting my short efficient code , it quickly solved the problem and Beats 90.45% of users with Python3 in Leetcode in terms of time which already good ,

but what about the remaining 9% ?
they all use TimSort default sorting function in python which is based on remembering many array cases .
